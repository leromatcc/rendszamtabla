This project contains the files used in mine undergraduate conclusion project.
My project proposes to create a system that recognizes the characteres and digits contained a licence-plate captured via a ip-camera. 
After identifying the contents of the licence-plate, process some business rules.
These business rules will define when to activate a arduino paired board.

The definitions where created in the last twelve months in my classes, with support of friends.

The implementation timeframe is three sprints of 24 hours.

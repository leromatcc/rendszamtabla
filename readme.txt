This project contains the files used on mine capstone project for the undergration on Computer Engineering.
My project proposes to create a system that recognizes the characters and digits contained in a licence-plate image acquired through a ip-camera. 
After identifying the contents of the licence-plate, process some business rules.
These business rules are published via webservices and will define when to activate a arduino paired board.

The definitions where created in the last twelve months in my classes, with support of friends.

The development was made entirely by me and most was learned using examples available on the web.

The implementation timeframe is one month for the computational objects and one month for the text.
